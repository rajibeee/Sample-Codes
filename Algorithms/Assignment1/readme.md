# Features!

A program to multiply two n-digit signed integers (where n ranges from 1 to 1000).

1. Gets a random signed integer from a range with n-size integers.
2. Fixes the start and end time of the multiplication.
3. Returns the sum space of variables and its multiplication time.
4. Adds the result of the function to the array.
5. Creates a float-type array using the numpy module.
6. Prints the min, max and mean time and space from the array.

## Installation

Python2.x should already be installed on Ubuntu. If it is not in your linux system then do the following:

```sh
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:fkrull/deadsnakes-python2.7
$ sudo apt-get update 
$ sudo apt-get install python2.7
```

The time, sys and numpy libraries imported for outputting the time and space of the multiplication operation.

The random library used to get random values from a range.

A user needs to install the numpy module in order to run the program:

```sh
$ sudo pip3 install numpy
```
